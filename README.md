For Twitter :
Make sure to replace the placeholder values in the consumer_key, consumer_secret, access_token, and access_token_secret variables with your own Twitter API credentials. You can obtain these credentials by creating a Twitter Developer account and registering a new application.

Once you have the script and the library installed, you can run it by executing the Python file. It will prompt you to enter the tweet message, and then it will post the tweet to your Twitter account.

Please note that each social media platform has its own API and authentication process. You'll need to refer to the documentation of the specific platform you want to post to, and adjust the code accordingly.

Remember to use social media automation responsibly and in compliance with the platform's terms of service and API usage policies.
